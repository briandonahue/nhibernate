Documentation notes:

- query_criteria
    ! Expression.sql example needs work (supplying an SqlString)
    ! document NH-specific Expression.Example stuff

- manipulating_data
    ! I'm unsure about the distributed transactions stuff

- persistent_classes
    - replace XDoclet markup section by NHMA example (at the end)?

- example_weblog
    - maybe use AddAssembly instead of two AddClass calls?

- transactions
    ! need to check ASP.NET example (do people store ISessionFactory in Application.Items?)
    ! do people store ISessionFactory in Active Directory?
    - stateless session bean = ? (paragraph removed completely)
    - is there really a "special handling of distributed transactions"?
    - should HttpSessionState be small in .NET?

- quickstart
    ! need to rename NHibernateUtil to something else
    ! say something about Embedded Resource there somewhere
    - add exception handling to static initializer of NHibernateUtil?

- toolset_guide
    - needs to be written
