<h1>Welcome to NHibernate.</h1>
<hr />
<p>
NHibernate is a .NET based object persistence library for relational databases.  NHibernate is a port of the excellent Java <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a> relational persistence tool.
</p>

<h2>Latest Version</h2>
<p>
Details of the latest version of NHibernate can be found on SourceForge at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate">http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate</a>. 
</p>

<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>
Documentation is very thin right now.  We are working on documenting the code as it is being developed.  We are going to add a step in our <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nant">NAnt</a> build files to build the API documentation in MSDN format thanks to <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc">NDoc</a>.  
</p>
<p>
We will ride the coat tails of Hibernate's excellent documentation for a while.  The first few docs will be describing the subtle differences between NHibernate and Hibernate - including the features found in Hibernate that have not been developed in NHibernate (yet).
</p>

<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
<p>
As we mentioned before, this software is still being developed.  So if you do find any bugs please use the <a href="http://jira.nhibernate.org:8080/">JIRA bug tracker</a> .
