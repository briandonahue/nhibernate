		<h1>Welcome to NHibernate.</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>
			NHibernate is a .NET based object persistence library for relational databases. 
			NHibernate is a port of the excellent Java <a href="http://hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
			relational persistence tool.
		</p>
		<h2>Latest Version</h2>
		<p>
			Details of the latest version of NHibernate can be found on SourceForge at 
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate">
			http://sourceforge.net/projects/nhibernate</a>.
		</p>
		<h2>Documentation</h2>
		<p>
			Documentation is very thin right now. We are working on documenting the code as 
			it is being developed. The API documentation is in MSDN format thanks to 
			<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ndoc">NDoc</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			We will ride the coat tails of Hibernate's excellent documentation for a while. 
			The Hibernate documentation for the version we are porting can be found at 
			<a href="http://nhibernate.sourceforge.net/h2.0.3-docs/reference/html/">
			http://nhibernate.sourceforge.net/h2.0.3-docs/reference/html/ </a>. 
		</p>
		<h2>Bug Reports</h2>
		<p>
			As we mentioned before, this software is still being developed. So if you do 
			find any bugs please use the <a href="http://jira.nhibernate.org/">JIRA bug 
				tracker</a> .
